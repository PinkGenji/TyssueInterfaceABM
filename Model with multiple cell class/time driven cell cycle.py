This script models a time driven (and only time) cell cycle. Following are the aims:
    (1) Mature CTs Cell gets recruited from mature into G2 with simple probability p
    (2) Cell does not grow but is programmed to stay in G2 for a fixed period of time
    (3) Cell moves to M phase and divides
    (4) Two daughter cells now in G1 don’t actively grow, but instead are programmed to stay in G1 for fixed amount of time
    (5) Cells move from G1 to M
    Note: the only 'cell growth' factor is the target area term in the energy function.
