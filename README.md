# tyssueHello
This is the repo to store my vertex modelling code on my project using Tyssue package. 

How to run the file "time driven cell cycle.py":
This script simulates a time-driven cell cycle using a vertex model with the Tyssue library. 
To run it, make sure you have Python installed along with the required dependencies: numpy, matplotlib, and tyssue. 
Then simply execute the script in a Python environment, and it will generate an initial cell sheet, simulate cell cycle progression, and visualize results. 
The simulation includes cell division and transitions between different cell cycle phases based on predefined probabilities and timers. Euler simple forward method is used to 
update the positions of vertices.
