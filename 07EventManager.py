'''
The event manager in tyssue is a system that manage the different behaviour of
a simulation.

It is compsoed of two lists:
    current: list of actions to be executed during the current simulation step.
    next: list of actions to be executed for the next simulation step, this list
    is fill during the current simulation step.

A behaviour is a function which describes/contains the actions requested to 
realize an event. For example, the behaviour which describe the cell division 
is composed of:
    -> growing cell area until it reaches a certain threshold
    -> dividing cell into two daughter cell

'''
Write a behaviour function:

Behaviour function have 2 parts:
    signature part; which contains sheet and manager parameter.
    keywords part; which is specific to one behaviour function.    

To add a behaviour to the manager, append method has to be used, and it needs 
as a parameter the function name and the keyword part.
