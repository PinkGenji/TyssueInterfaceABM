# bilayer_solver_dev

This folder contains development code for testing and modifying solvers in Tyssue, 
focusing on a bilayer setup.

## Workflow
1. Create a bilayer (no multiple CT layers).
2. Demonstrate Euler solver with cell division.
3. Modify the Euler solver in Tyssue and test.
4. Add a fusion on/off switch and demonstrate.
